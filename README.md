# Loot Deals - Affiliate Deal Tracker

This is a frontend application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS that displays affiliate product deals. It features separate sections for live and recently expired deals, simulated user authentication, order tracking, and an admin panel for deal management.

## Running the Application Locally

This project was bootstrapped with a standard React setup (like Vite or Create React App). To run it on your local machine:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js (v16 or later)
    *   A package manager like `npm` or `yarn`

2.  **Installation:**
    Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Running the Development Server:**
    Once the installation is complete, start the local development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev 
    # or `npm start` if using Create React App
    ```
    This will open the application in your default web browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Host This Website (Making it a Live Site)

The user requested information on how to make this a fully workable live site. The provided code is for the **frontend only**. To make this a complete, live application with real user accounts and persistent data, you will need a **backend** and a **database**.

### Path 1: Hosting as a Static Site (Simple, Limited Functionality)

You can host the current frontend code on platforms that specialize in static sites.

*   **How it Works:** You build the React app into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files (`npm run build`) and upload the contents of the `dist` (or `build`) folder to the hosting service.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   **No Real Users:** The login is fake. Anyone can type any email to get in. There's no password protection.
    *   **No Persistent Data:** All deals are hardcoded. Any deals added by the "admin" will disappear on page refresh. Orders are not saved.
*   **Best Platforms for This:**
    *   **Vercel:** Excellent for React apps, very easy to use. Connects directly to your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab) and auto-deploys on changes. **Cost: Generous free tier is likely sufficient for this app.**
    *   **Netlify:** Similar to Vercel, also with a great free tier and Git integration.
    *   **GitHub Pages:** Free hosting directly from a GitHub repository. A bit more manual to set up with React routing but very reliable. **Cost: Free.**
*   **Cost:** For a simple static site with moderate traffic, you can expect to pay **$0/month** using the free tiers of these services.

### Path 2: Building a Full-Stack Application (Complex, Full Functionality)

To achieve all the requested features (real user accounts, saving orders, admin panel that saves data), you need to build a backend service.

*   **Architecture:**
    1.  **Frontend (This React App):** The user interface. Instead of using hardcoded data, it will make API calls to your backend.
    2.  **Backend (API Server):**
        *   Handles user registration and login (e.g., saving user credentials securely).
        *   Connects to a database to store and retrieve deals, users, and orders.
        *   Provides API endpoints like `GET /api/deals`, `POST /api/deals`, `POST /api/orders`.
        *   Popular backend technologies include **Node.js with Express**, Python with Django/Flask, Ruby on Rails, etc.
    3.  **Database:**
        *   Stores all your data.
        *   Options include **PostgreSQL** (relational), **MongoDB** (NoSQL), or a Backend-as-a-Service like **Firebase**.

*   **Hosting a Full-Stack App:**
    *   **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) - Easiest:**
        *   **Firebase (Google):** Provides authentication, a real-time database (Firestore), and hosting all in one package. This is a great choice for beginners as it simplifies backend development significantly. You would integrate the Firebase SDK into your React app.
        *   **Supabase (Open Source):** An open-source alternative to Firebase that provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and auto-generated APIs.
        *   **Cost:** Both have free tiers that are suitable for starting out. Costs will scale with usage (database reads/writes, user count). Expect **$0 to $25/month** for a small-to-medium application.

    *   **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) - More Control:**
        *   You write your backend code and deploy it to a platform that manages the servers for you.
        *   **Vercel/Netlify:** Can host both your React frontend and your serverless backend functions.
        *   **Render:** Very easy to use for deploying Node.js/Python backends and PostgreSQL databases.
        *   **Heroku:** A classic PaaS, though its free tier has become more limited.
        *   **Cost:** You'll typically have a separate cost for the frontend, backend, and database. With free tiers, you might start at **$0/month**, but a realistic budget for a small live app would be **$15 to $50/month**.

### Summary & Recommendation

1.  **Start Simple:** Deploy the current React application to **Vercel** or **Netlify** for free to have a live, shareable version of the frontend.
2.  **Evolve to Full-Stack:** When you're ready for real users and data, choose a BaaS like **Firebase** or **Supabase**. This is the fastest way to add backend functionality without becoming a backend expert. You will need to modify the React code to fetch data from Firebase/Supabase instead of the `constants.ts` file.
